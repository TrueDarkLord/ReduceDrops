# What is this plugin?
Reduced Drops is a plugin that aims to reduce the clutter and quantity of entities that are present in your world. This is done to allow players to easily get their drops as well as reduce server lag.

# Features
Items are automatically picked up when breaking blocks.
Loot automatically is added to the player's inventory when they kill mobs or other players.

  Currently, there are no config options for the plugin, but we can add them later if there is interest in the project.

# Setup:
[Download](https://modrinth.com/plugin/reduced-drops) the jar file.
Place the file into your server's plugin folder.
Start the server and Enjoy!

### History
This plugin was designed with simplicity in mind to reduce the chances of it breaking during updates. It was created as a simple plugin that utilizes newer APIs to address issues that older plugins of similar type have faced.
